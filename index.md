## Why build a dictionary?

The future is big. To model and forecast it, we’re going to need to put probabilities on *a lot* of questions.

The AI Dictionary is one piece of the puzzle for unlocking economies-of-scale for AI forecasting.

### Low overhead

When writers don’t have to reinvent the wheel whenever they operationalise a new thought, and forecasters can reduce the drag of constantly interpreting new resolutions, we can both generate and answer more questions.

### High signal

Capturing what matters in a detailed, technical question is hard. We can make that high initial cost worth it by ensuring it is broadly used and built upon.

### Stable yet flexible

Drawing upon best practices for software version management, we can allow resolution conditions that change and improve over time while maintaining the precision necessary for quantitative reasoning.

## How do I use the Dictionary?

Simply write a question relying on definitions from the Dictionary, and appending the tag [ai-dict-vX.Y.Z] at the end of the relevant string, or somewhere in an accompanying description.

For example:

`I predict that image classification will be made robust against
adversarial examples by 2023. [ai-dict-v2]`

`Will there be a superhuman Starcraft agent trained using less than $10.000 of publicly available compute by 2025? [ai-dict-v1.0.4]`
